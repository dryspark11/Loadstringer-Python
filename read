a loadstringer built in Python. Inspiration from https://loadstringer.mattlawz.dev

This is a tool made for exploiters or people who use it for ethical purposes. it doesnt matter to me.

Basically what this does is you get your scripts RAW link, then paste it into loadstringer app, and it turns it into a loadstring.

Again, this idea wasnt from me. This was all taken from https://loadstringer.mattlawz.dev

If the original creator wants this down, tell me.
